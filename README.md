//         talented and your brainpower can help save a life with your contributions to this project.
// 
//      NOTE: 
//         My family experienced some serious targeted trolling/hacking/identity-theft/Defamation(Not Defacation)/
//         and had an all-around bad time. It was like torture at times and at times each of us wanted to die and 
//         were hurt and scarred emotionally over these events. In short I don't want another human being feeling 
//         the way that any of us felt throughtout this entire ordeal. So I decided I want to do something about it. 
//         I don't know what I'm doing, but hopefully with some help from the community we can collectively come up
//         with a solution that can save a Relationship, Friendship, Marriage, or maybe even a life. God Bless you 
//         all in whatever form or whatever your understanding of God to you is, I hope that many blessings fall upon 
//         thee. With that being said, Please feel free to contribute
//
